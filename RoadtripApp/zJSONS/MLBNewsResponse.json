    "Content": "Miami Marlins outfielder Starling  Marte (hand) is uncertain on his availability for the National League Division Series against the Braves this week. Marte fractured his pinky after getting hit by a pitch in Game 1 against the Cubs, and the team has \"no determination\" on the status of the 31-year-old, according to manager Don Mattingly. If Marte is not able to join the team on the NLDS roster, outfielder Magneuris  Sierra could earn another start in center field after being included in the starting lineup for Game 2 against the Cubs. Marte's status should be known closer to the start of the series on Tuesday night, with the roster submission deadline happening earlier in the day.",

    "Content": "New York Yankees catcher Kyle  Higashioka will be the primary catcher for starting pitcher Gerrit  Cole through the rest of the playoffs, according to manager Aaron Boone. That declaration has Higashioka slated to start behind the plate against the Rays on Monday, and Monday will be Coles sixth consecutive start with Higashioka behind the plate. A superior defensive catcher compared to Gary  Sanchez, Higashiokas presence bolsters Coles already high fantasy value through the playoffs, but the 30-year-olds career .602 OPS should keep him off of most fantasy rosters.",

Having battled a quad injury since Sunday, Vogelbach is healthy enough to swing the bat and run, which likely will limit him for as long as the opening round series goes. He packs premium power potential, but at less than full strength, he represents an option for being removed late in contests.",

Both pitchers are rotation options for the wild-card series against the Cardinals, which starts on Wednesday. They're unlikely to start in Game 1 since they haven't thrown a bullpen session since their injuries. Zach  Davies is the only starter guaranteed to be in the wild-card series rotation, and he was arguably their best starter during the season with a 2.73 ERA over 12 starts. Because of quick turnarounds after their injuries if they pitch against the Cardinals in the wild-card series, both Lamet and Clevinger would be risk\/reward DFS picks.",

Encouragingly, Happs strikeout rate (22.4%) and xwOBAcon (.355) are back near his pre-2019 numbers, suggesting that his bounce-back may be real.

With an uncertain offseason facing many top stars, and injuries riddling Stantons tenure in New York, there was literal reason to believe that he would invoke the opt-out clause which was instituted when he originally signed with Miami. (The Marlins will have to pay New York $30 million upon Stanton's return to the Yankees.) Stanton has mashed to the tune of a .915 OPS this year, but has been limited to just 21 games.
