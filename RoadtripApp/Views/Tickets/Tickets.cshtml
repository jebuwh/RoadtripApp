             The not often talked about, but essential key in purchasing great MLB tickets is not how close you sit to the field, but where the sun will be during your game!
             If you get great seats right on the field, but end up with the sun in your eyes the majority of the game, it makes for a much less fun trip!

             Please refer to the Home Plate Direction information on the Stadiums page. If the ballpark you plan to attend has a Home Plate Angle between ~120-210, it
             is highly recommended, the lower the angle to sit more behind home plate, and as the angle increases move towards the 3rd base side. If your chosen ballpark has a
             Home Plate Angle below 120, it is recommended to start behind home plate, and the lower the angle move more towards the 1st base side. Obviously if you are
             attending a game at an indoor or dome stadium this information can be ignored. This will help you have a much more enjoyable time at your game!
